# LaTeX Resume

The goal of this project is to create a standalone LaTeX based resume that does not depend on any external packages or addons.

The resume.tex will use custom commands to format each section of the resume.

* \myname - Print out my name on the top of the resume
* \myhead - Print the section heading
* \company - Prints and indents the company name
* \position - Prints and indents the position title and date
* \skill - creates a bulleted list of skills for each job


# Usage

Install the TexLive-Core pasckage.

run 

	pdflatex resume.tex

it will generate the resume.pdf file.
